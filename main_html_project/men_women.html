    <p>
      Once upon a time Martians and Venusians met, fell in love, and had happy
      relationships together because they respected and accepted their
      differences. Then they came to Earth and amnesia set in: they forgot they
      were from different planets.

      Based on years of successful counseling of couples and individuals, Men
      Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus has helped millions of couples
      transform their relationships. Now viewed as a modern classic, this
      phenomenal book has helped men and women realize how different they really
      are and how to communicate their needs in such a way that conflict doesn't
      arise and intimacy is given every chance to grow!!!!
